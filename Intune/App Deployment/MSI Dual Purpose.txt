Symptom:
	Deploying Remote Desktop Client via Intune, option to install as device missing
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/windowsdesktop#install-the-client
	Without checking device install, issues were seen where app would not deploy

Background:
	Deploying Remote Desktop Client with parameter "ALLUSERS=1" (Device install)
	Found that Intune uses the ALLUSERS property to determine if .msi is user/device/dual-purpose (both)

Tested:
	Submitting feedback to Microsoft asking them to make MSI a dual-purpose install

Fix:
	Verify that the .msi is set to "user only" (missing ALLUSERS)
		Ran the following vbs script against the msi
			set o_installer = CreateObject("WindowsInstaller.Installer")
			set o_database = o_installer.OpenDatabase("RemoteDesktop_1.2.1844.0_x64.msi", 1)
			s_SQL = "SELECT Property, Value FROM Property"
			Set o_MSIView = o_DataBase.OpenView(s_SQL)
			o_MSIView.Execute

			Do
				Set o_MSIRecord = o_MSIView.Fetch
				i=0
				if o_MSIRecord Is Nothing Then Exit Do
				WScript.Echo o_MSIRecord.StringData(1)+"="+o_MSIRecord.StringData(2)
				i = i + 1
			Loop
	Ran the following vbs script to add the property
		set o_installer = CreateObject("WindowsInstaller.Installer")
		set o_database = o_installer.OpenDatabase("RemoteDesktop_1.2.1844.0_x64.msi", 1)
		s_SQL = "SELECT Property, Value FROM Property"
		Set o_MSIView = o_DataBase.OpenView(s_SQL)
		o_MSIView.Execute
		Set o_MSIInsert = o_Database.OpenView("Insert INTO Property (Property, Value) Values ('ALLUSERS','2')")
		o_MSIInsert.Execute
		o_DataBase.Commit
	Uploaded updated .msi to Intune and option to install as device was now allowed

TODO:
	Convert script to powershell file
