Symptom:
Adding printer causes error "Printer driver was not installed. Unable to find a core driver package that is required by the printer driver package."

Background:
Server 2012 R2 x64
Recently updated
Xerox Copiers

Tested:
Removing all printer driver packages
	PrintManagement screen (added print server to roles/features)
Manually deleting driver files out of C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers
	Renaming the drivers folder and restarting spooler seemed to do this quite well
Manually deleting driver packages
	dism /online /get-drivers /format:table
		Can out to file for better readability
	pnputil /delete-driver <Published name>
	
	***ONLY REMOVE PRINTERS - Look at the "Class Name"***

What should be the fix:
	For my known good machine, I used the same kind (2012r2 with similar updates). I'd recommend verifying the OS build number to make sure your two machines are similar
	
	Find the GUID of the missing driver from Event Viewer
		Event Viewer - Application and Services Logs - Microsoft - Windows - PrintService - Admin
		Find the errors and under the "Details" tab one of the errors will say something like this:
			Message: Unable to find core dependency (see additional info for driver GUID)
			AdditionalInfo: {D20EA372-DD35-4950-9ED8-A6335AFE79F1} (NOTE: Your GUID might be different)
		NOTE: Searching for the GUID that was missing for me returned the following page:
			https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/print/package-aware-print-drivers-that-share-files
			Notice Core File
				PSCRIPT = {D20EA372-DD35-4950-9ED8-A6335AFE79F1}
			At this point I knew it was something built into windows (Post Script Driver)
	On a known good machine, find out what the GUID is
		HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Print\PackageInstallation\ is a great place to look
			I found mine under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Print\PackageInstallation\Windows x64\CorePrinterDrivers
		Clicking on the GUID in registry showed me that it was the x64 ntprint and where it was looking
			InfPath: C:\WINDOWS\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\ntprint.inf_amd64_3138b2c823dd1ea9\ntprint.inf
				NOTE: Your path might be different! It seems like the part after amd64_ changes with each update to the file. It is important to have a similar machine to check this.
	I was able to verify that the above path was missing, and I was able to confirm what the path should be, since there was an x86 driver on the broken machine with the same ending
		ntprint.inf_x86_3138b2c823dd1ea9
	Copy the folder from a known good machine to the broken machine
	On the broken machine, check to see if registry keys are missing (mine were)
		HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Print\PackageInstallation\Windows x64\CorePrinterDrivers\{D20EA372-DD35-4950-9ED8-A6335AFE79F1}
		HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Print\PackageInstallation\Windows x64\DriverPackages\ntprint.inf_amd64_3138b2c823dd1ea9
	Export Keys from known good and import to broken machine
