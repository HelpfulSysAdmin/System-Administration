# Hello, World!
I believe that System Administration can be great for everyone if there was a place to share best practices and how to solve those really weird one-off issues.

Ideally everything will be broken down to it's most simple parts so it's easy to understand and you don't have to spend hours reading it.

# TODO
Sometimes things can't be finished 100%. 

This will be used where something needs finished, tested, or maybe even left to do later!

# Formatting
TODO: Figure out a good formatting for all this stuff.
